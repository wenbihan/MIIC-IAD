# MIIC Dataset for Image Anomaly Detection
Microscopic Images of Integrated Circuits (MIIC)
=============

Dataset description:

MIIC is a novel dataset of real microscopic images of integrated circuits (ICs), to benchmark the IAD algorithms. The MIIC dataset includes 25,160 normal and 116 anomalous high-resolution IC images obtained by ScanningElectron Microscopy (SEM). The SEM images are taken at the metal layer of a manufactured IC and are in gray-scale with a dimension of 512x512 pixels. For each image containing anomalies, we provide differ-ent types of annotations, including the bounding box and pixel-wise ground truth mask for them, which enables future research toward various computer vision applications.
